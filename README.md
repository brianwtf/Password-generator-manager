# Password Manager & Generator

## Overview

This is a simple, yet effective password manager and generator built with Python using `tkinter` for the graphical user interface (GUI), `cryptography.fernet` for encryption, and random password generation. The program allows you to generate secure passwords, save them securely, and access them later with encryption.

The project also includes a dark/light mode toggle for a better user experience.
